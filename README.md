Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/ietuday/user-login-system.git

# Change directory
cd user-login-system

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm start
```

You can use Nodemon : It watches for any changes in your node.js app and
automatically restarts the server. Once installed, instead if `node app.js` use
`nodemon app.js`. It will save a lot of time in the long run, because you won't
need to manually restart the server each time you make a small change in code.
To install, run `sude npm install -g nodemon`.
